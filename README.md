# Dawnbot Discordbot

## Atention

You must use a .env file including a *discord bot token*, a *random message* and the bot admin *info*. (env files are to be used mostly with heroku (In this project), you may need to work arround if you want to use env without).

## TODOS:
* Develop other things that the bot may do
